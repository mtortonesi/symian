Symian is a tool, based on what-if scenario analysis and discrete-event
simulation, for the modeling of a hierarchical and multi-level incident
management structures. The simulative approach allows to extract important
metrics and statistics in complex and dynamic systems, which would otherwise be
impossible to obtain by means of the analytical approach. Symian allows to test
corrective actions on the architecture itself of support groups before
executing them in practice.

## NOTE

I am still in the process of cleaning up the Symian code. As soon as I am done,
I will commit it here and upload updated installation and usage information.
